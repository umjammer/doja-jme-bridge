/**
 * Implements a &quot;ticker-tape&quot;, a piece of text that runs
 * continuously across the display. The direction and speed of scrolling are
 * determined by the implementation. While animating, the ticker string
 * scrolls continuously. That is, when the string finishes scrolling off the
 * display, the ticker starts over at the beginning of the string. 
 *
 * <p> There is no API provided for starting and stopping the ticker. The
 * application model is that the ticker is always scrolling continuously.
 * However, the implementation is allowed to pause the scrolling for power
 * consumption purposes, for example, if the user doesn't interact with the
 * device for a certain period of time. The implementation should resume
 * scrolling the ticker when the user interacts with the device again. </p>
 *
 * <p>The text of the ticker may contain
 * <A HREF="Form.html#linebreak">line breaks</A>.
 * The complete text MUST be displayed in the ticker;
 * line break characters should not be displayed but may be used 
 * as separators. </p>
 * 
 * <p> The same ticker may be shared by several <code>Displayable</code>
 * objects (&quot;screens&quot;). This can be accomplished by calling
 * {@link Displayable#setTicker setTicker()} on each of them.
 * Typical usage is for an application to place the same ticker on
 * all of its screens. When the application switches between two screens that
 * have the same ticker, a desirable effect is for the ticker to be displayed
 * at the same location on the display and to continue scrolling its contents
 * at the same position. This gives the illusion of the ticker being attached
 * to the display instead of to each screen. </p>
 *
 * <p> An alternative usage model is for the application to use different
 * tickers on different sets of screens or even a different one on each
 * screen. The ticker is an attribute of the <code>Displayable</code> class
 * so that
 * applications may implement this model without having to update the ticker
 * to be displayed as the user switches among screens. </p>
